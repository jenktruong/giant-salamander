## Introduction

## Data and Methods

"Old Growth" refers to the 500 year old coniferous forest upstream, while "Clear Cut" refers to the clear-cut section of the forest.

## Results

```{r}
# Data frame to pull for all results. 
mack_creek_data <- mack_creek_df %>% 
<<<<<<< HEAD
  select(entity, section, weight)

# Note: Weights is in grams (from metadata)
=======
  select(entity, section, weight, year)
>>>>>>> bd7799770dc93d59e94041fead3f724fd7137576
```

### A. Annual Salamander Counts in Old Growth (OG) and Clear Cut (CC) Sections of Mack Creek

```{r}
# Counting for section (clear and old growth)

mack_creek_cc_og <- mack_creek_data %>% 
  count(section, year)

mack_creek_cc_og
```

```{r}
# Graph for changes in yearly salamander population in these two sections over time 

ggplot(data = mack_creek_cc_og, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = n))
```
